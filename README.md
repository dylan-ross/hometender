## Project Description
Search for a cocktail by name. Compare up to 3 cocktails at a time. Search results are images that when interacted with will reveal recipe and glassware. Additional features include a search by ingredient form that will result in a list of all cocktails with that ingredient. Cocktail names in that list will link to image/recipe reveal.
